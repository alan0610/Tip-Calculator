## My process

I divided the process into several parts. First the input part where the total bill, the different tipping options and the number of people. Then the results both the tip total per person and the total bill per person. I started with the HTML of the input first, then its CSS and so, move to the output part. Finally, make it responsive and adding all the functionalities with JavaScript.
